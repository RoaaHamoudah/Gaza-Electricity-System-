# Gaza-Electricity-System
This project focuses on developing an Electricity Data Management System with a user-friendly interface. 
Using a combined sorted linked list, it handles daily electricity records sourced from a CSV file. Users can add, update, delete, and search records. 
Statistical insights are available, and the system allows for easy saving of modified data.
